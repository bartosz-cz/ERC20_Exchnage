Exchange Contract
This repository contains the Solidity smart contract code for an Ethereum-based decentralized exchange. The Exchange contract manages token transactions, user requests, and ownership transfers.

Features
Token Trading: Supports buying and selling ERC20 tokens.
Request Management: Tracks and manages user requests for buying and selling tokens.
Ownership Management: Handles the ownership of the contract with secure transfer mechanisms.
Reentrancy Protection: Ensures that functions are protected against reentrancy attacks.
Contract Overview
The Exchange contract includes several key functionalities:

Ownership Transfer: Allows the current owner to transfer ownership securely to a new owner.
Transaction Requests: Users can place buy or sell requests which are matched by the contract.
Cancel Requests: Users can cancel their unfulfilled requests.
Secure Transfers: Ensures all token and Ether transfers are executed safely and correctly.
Key Components
contractOwner: The current owner of the contract.
nextContractOwner: The prospective new owner, during the ownership transfer process.
UserRequest: Struct to store user request details such as the token address, amount, and price.
Requests: Mapping to track the requests of each user.
sellRequestants and buyRequestants: Mappings to manage lists of users interested in selling or buying tokens.
Modifiers
allowOnly: Restricts function access to authorized users.
noReentrancy: Prevents reentrancy attacks by marking functions in progress.
Setup and Deployment
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm
Truffle Suite or Hardhat
Ganache (for local blockchain simulation)
Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/exchange-contract.git
cd exchange-contract
npm install
Compilation and Deployment
Compile the contract using Truffle or Hardhat:

bash
Copy code
truffle compile
Deploy the contract to a local blockchain for testing:

bash
Copy code
truffle migrate --reset
Testing
Run the test cases with Truffle or Hardhat:

bash
Copy code
truffle test
Usage
To interact with the deployed contract, use the Truffle console or scripts:

bash
Copy code
truffle console
Then, interact with the deployed contract:

javascript
Copy code
const contract = await Exchange.deployed();
await contract.initiateOwnershipTransfer('newOwnerAddress');
